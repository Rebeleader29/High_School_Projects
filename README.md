These are (mostly) batch scripts I wrote in high school. They had blocked using CMD but forgot to block running .bat files. From here my programming journey began.
GetIP was a scrip that pinged every IP in a subnet and returned information if the host was up and other information like who was currently logged on (thanks windows AD)
