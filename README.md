These are (mostly) batch scripts I wrote in high school. They had blocked using CMD but forgot to block running .bat files. From here my programming journey began.

GetIP was a scrip that pinged every IP in a subnet and returned information if the host was up and other information like who was currently logged on (thanks windows AD)

LFG or Large File Generator what a very simple script that just generated a file and continuously increased its size. If memory serves correctly I was trying to see how quickly I could fill up the school network drive. But the issue I ran into was the program was exceptionally slow.
